# For the rest of the lesson you will be working with a drone that is able to move in two dimensions. 
# 
# This drone has two propellers each located a distance $l$ from the center of mass. In this exercise, we will ignore the yaw-inducing reactive moment from each propeller.
# 
# The state can be described by the vector: 
# 
# $$X = [z , y, \phi, \dot{z}, \dot{y},\dot{\phi}]$$
# 
# We will have to track the drone's position in 2 dimensions and its rotation about the $x$ axis, which is directed into the plane.
