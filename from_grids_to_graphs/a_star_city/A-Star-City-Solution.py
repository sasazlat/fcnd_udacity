# ## Finding Your Way In The City
#
# In this notebook you'll combine the work of previous exercises to calculate a
# minimal series of waypoints in order to get from a start location to a goal
# location.
#
# You'll reuse and modify your algorithms from:
#
# - A*
# - Configuration Space
# - Collinearity and/or Bresenham

# In[1]:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from grid import create_grid
from planning import a_star

#get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# In[2]:

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 12, 12


# You'll notice we've imported `create_grid`, and `a_star`.  These are
# functions you've implemented in previous exercises, you'll use them to create
# a map and find a path from a starting position to a goal position.
#
# To read the function signature and documentation execute `?` followed by the
# function name in a cell.  In the example below we'll check the documentation
# for `create_grid`.

#get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'create_grid')


# If you would like to alter these implementations, you can modify
# [grid.py](/edit/grid.py) and [planning.py](/edit/planning.py) in the current
# directory.

# A*.

# Start and goal coordinates in *(north, east)*.

# Let's plot the path!

# In[11]:

plt.imshow(grid, cmap='Greys', origin='lower')

# For the purposes of the visual the east coordinate lay along
# the x-axis and the north coordinates long the y-axis.
plt.plot(start_ne[1], start_ne[0], 'x')
plt.plot(goal_ne[1], goal_ne[0], 'x')

plt.plot(pp[:, 1], pp[:, 0], 'g')

plt.xlabel('EAST')
plt.ylabel('NORTH')

# Pretty neat!  Unfortunately this path is impractical, the drone would be
# constantly stopping and going since each grid cell visited is synonymous with
# a waypoint.  Ideally, we'd like to only consider a new waypoint when the
# drone's direction changes.  Path pruning is one way to achieve this result.

# Complete the `prune_path` function below.  It should return a new path much
# shorter than the original.

        # If the 3 points are in a line remove
        # the 2nd point.
        # The 3rd point now becomes and 2nd point
        # and the check is redone with a new third point
        # on the next iteration.

# Now the waypoints symbolize a change in direction, much better!
