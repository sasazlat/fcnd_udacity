# Your task is to implement the bresenham function given two points $p_1$ and
# $p_2$ as inputs.  The function should return the list of grid cells required
# to draw the line.
#
# What conditions would warrant a move by 1 unit along the x-axis?  What about
# along the y-axis?
#
# The idea is to move based on whether the next $y$ value will be above or
# below the line from $p_1$ to $p_2$.  We can keep track of the current line
# value, effectively $f(x)$ where $f$ is the line equation by incrementing a
# counter variable by the slope $m$ whenever we move in the x-axis.
#
# The condition is then (in pseudocode):
#
# ```
# if f(x+1) > y + 1:
#     y += 1
# else:
#     x += 1
# ```
#
# So, if moving along the y-axis results in a y value that is below the line,
# then move along the y-axis, otherwise, move in the x-axis.
#
# But what about the case where `f(x+1) == y+1`?  This will be the result of
# every test case when the line slope `m = 1`.  In this case you have a choice
# to make:
# * Only identify cells that as "in collision" when the line actually passes
# through those cells (less conservative obstacle avoidance)
# * When the line passes directly through a corner of grid cells, identify all
# cells that share that corner as "in collision" (more conservative obstacle
# avoidance).
#
# These two options look like this for a line from (0, 0) to (5, 5):
#
# ![comparison](./bresenham_comparison.png)
#
# Try coding up both!  In the event that you've padded obstacles in your grid
# map with a sufficient safety margin, you can likely get away with the less
# conservative approach (or computer graphics based Bresenham implementation in
# the Python package shown below).

# ### Python Bresenham Package
# For comparison let's have a look at the Python Bresenham package!  As
# mentioned above, if you've added a safety margin around obstacles you are
# probably fine using this package or one like it that misses some cells in
# collision with the line.
#
# First we need to import it:

# In[6]:
from bresenham import bresenham


# Next we can run the same experiment as above and plot it up.

# Note: you can run this for any (x1, y1, x2, y2)
