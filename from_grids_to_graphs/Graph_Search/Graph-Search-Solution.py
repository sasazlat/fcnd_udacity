# ## Finding Your Way In The City (Graph Edition)
# In this notebook your attention will shift from grids to graphs.  At least
# for search ...  the world representation is still a grid.  You likely noticed
# in the previous notebook the generated paths flew as close to the obstacle /
# safety space as possible.
#
# Using Voronoi graphs and the medial axis transform we can find paths which
# maximize safety from obstacles.  In addition, graph representation allows
# further optimizations and more succinct queries.

# We now have a graph, well at least visually.  The next step is to use the
# [`networkx`](https://networkx.github.io) to create the graph.  **NetworkX**
# is a popular library handling anything and everything related to graph data
# structures and algorithms.
#
# **NOTE:** In the initial import above it was imported with the `nx` alias.
#
# You're encouraged to read the documentation but here's a super quick tour:
#
# 1.  Create a graph:
#
# ```
# G = nx.Graph()
# ```
#
# 2.  Add an edge:
#
# ```
# p1 = (10, 2.2)
# p2 = (50, 40)
# G = nx.add_edge(p1, p2)
# ```
#
# 3 Add an edge with a weight:
#
# ```
# p1 = (10, 2.2)
# p2 = (50, 40)
# dist = LA.norm(np.array(p2) - np.array(p1))
# G = nx.add_edge(p1, p2, weight=dist)
# ```

# In[ ]:


# TODO: create the graph with the weight of the edges
# set to the Euclidean distance between the points
G = nx.Graph()
for e in edges:
    p1 = e[0]
    p2 = e[1]
    dist = LA.norm(np.array(p2) - np.array(p1))
    G.add_edge(p1, p2, weight=dist)


# We need a method to search the graph, we'll adapt A* in order to do this.
# The notable differences being the actions are now the outgoing edges and the
# cost of an action is that weight of that edge.

# ### Solution
#
# This solution consists of two parts:
#
# 1.  Find the closest point in the graph to our current location, same thing
# for the goal location.
# 2.  Compute the path from the two points in the graph using the A* algorithm.
# 3.  Feel free to use any of the path pruning techniques to make the path even
# smaller!
